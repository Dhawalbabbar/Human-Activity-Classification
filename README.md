Activity Classification with Oculus Data
Steps-
1. Generating our own data with oculous rift and extracting useful elements form from it.
2. Labeling the data manually 
3. loading all the data to a single file and randomizing it.
4. Arranging and configuring the data to be build in LSTM neural network.
5. Training and finding the best learning rate, Batch size, training iterations,etc.
6. Finally getting the results on validation and test sets.
7. Display the results

Result-
Final Accuracy -85% 

Trying other models
I Tried other models like KNN, Gaussian Naieve Baise, and desision tree classifier and compared it to LSTM.
